When changing prices or quantities, we optionally prorate the price we charge next month to make up for any price changes. To preview how the proration is calculated, use the create preview endpoint. By default, we prorate subscription changes. For example, if a customer signs up on May 1 for a 100 price, they\u2019ll be billed 100 immediately. If on May 15 they switch to a 200 price, then on June 1 they\u2019ll be billed 250 (200 for a renewal of her subscription, plus a 50 prorating adjustment for half of the previous month\u2019s 100 difference). Similarly, a downgrade generates a credit that is applied to the next invoice. We also prorate when you make quantity changes. Switching prices does not normally change the billing date or generate an immediate charge unless: The billing interval is changed (for example, from monthly to yearly). The subscription moves from free to paid. A trial starts or ends. In these cases, we apply a credit for the unused time on the previous price, immediately charge the customer using the new price, and reset the billing date. Learn about how Stripe immediately attempts payment for subscription changes. If you want to charge for an upgrade immediately, pass proration_behavior as always_invoice to create prorations, automatically invoice the customer for those proration adjustments, and attempt to collect payment. If you pass create_prorations, the prorations are created but not automatically invoiced. If you want to bill the customer for the prorations before the subscription\u2019s renewal date, you need to manually invoice the customer. If you don\u2019t want to prorate, set the proration_behavior option to none. With this option, the customer is billed 100 on May 1 and 200 on June 1. Similarly, if you set proration_behavior to none when switching between different billing intervals (for example, from monthly to yearly), we don\u2019t generate any credits for the old subscription\u2019s unused time. We still reset the billing date and bill immediately for the new subscription. Updating the quantity on a subscription many times in an hour may result in rate limiting. If you need to bill for a frequently changing quantity, consider integrating usage-based billing instead."

The excess amount is indicated by post_payment_amount, and it can result in any combination of the following: Refunds: create a new refund (using refund_amount) or link existing refunds (using refunds). Customer balance credit: credit the customer\u2019s balance (using credit_amount) which will be automatically applied to their next invoice when it\u2019s finalized. Outside of Stripe credit: record the amount that is or will be credited outside of Stripe (using out_of_band_amount). The sum of refunds, customer balance credits, and outside of Stripe credits must equal the post_payment_amount. You may issue multiple credit notes for an invoice. Each credit note may increment the invoice\u2019s pre_payment_credit_notes_amount, post_payment_credit_notes_amount, or both, depending on the invoice\u2019s amount_remaining at the time of credit note creation."

This will show you all the charges that are pending, including subscription renewal charges, invoice item charges, etc. It will also show you any discounts that are applicable to the invoice. You can also preview the effects of creating or updating a subscription or subscription schedule, including a preview of any prorations that will take place. To ensure that the actual proration is calculated exactly the same as the previewed proration, you should pass the subscription_details.proration_date parameter when doing the actual subscription update. The recommended way to get only the prorations being previewed on the invoice is to consider line items where parent.subscription_item_details.proration is true. Note that when you are viewing an upcoming invoice, you are simply viewing a preview \u2013 the invoice has not yet been created. As such, the upcoming invoice will not show up in invoice listing calls, and you cannot use the API to pay or edit the invoice. If you want to change the amount that your customer will be billed, you can add, remove, or update pending invoice items, or update the customer\u2019s discount. Note: Currency conversion calculations use the latest exchange rates. Exchange rates may vary between the time of the preview and the time of the actual invoice creation. Learn more"
